# Vector Perturbation Precoding (VPP) via QUBO

QUBOVPP implements **Vector Perturbation Precoding (VPP)** for downlink multi-user MIMO using a **QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)** formulation.  
The focus is on understanding the role of the **spacing parameter τ (tau)**, the **structure of the QUBO matrix**, and the **bit-error-rate (BER) performance** compared with conventional baselines.

The work is motivated by discussions on whether QUBO-based VPP behaves similarly to conventional VPP and MIMO detection, especially for **QPSK**.
